Who doesn't like a hearty feast in the late evenings? Especially when you are dining out alone and the table is full of your favourite dishes and delicacies! You savour the great taste by indulging in a little tasting ceremony wherein your taste buds take the front seat. The cherry on top is the moment when the waiter serves you the dishes you wished to relish. All those moments of genuine patient wait turns to instant gratification when the waiter elegantly utters, "Your order is ready, sir. Please have it." You start warming up and getting yourself ready to make the first big bite, while also letting your foodie desires take over!

Leave the taste alone, the very sight of the hot items emanating an incredible aroma and also the steam dancing skillfully to reach their ultimate abode is a scene to behold! The cleverly garnished items, the rich blend of exotic colours, the succulent and tender meat cooked with great care is nothing short of spectacular. What I like to think about is the benefits of having a nutritious mean every once in a while. While it's evident that it provides great nutrition, it can't be denied as well how much good you feel after finishing the load all by yourself!

I prefer to have a feast where I visualise myself devouring the meat fully and getting all those proteins. But, one thing about hearty meals is that you need to have such meals after considerably long periods and that too when you can eat a horse! To spice things up, have the winter season setting in place, as stomach ailments seem to happen less in winters for tropical countries. I mean to say you can intensify your gobbling speed that time of the year! If all these conditions meet, then it's one's rightful duty to term such feast as a hearty meal.

A healthy, nutritious and delicious meal which nudges you to say, "I'm full" is a meal worth having once in a while. It not only satisfies you but also gives you much needed energy, which is vital especially when you are young and growing. It not only provides you vital nutrients and minerals but also helps you fight various kinds of diseases and prevents ailments. Finally, it not only provides you ways to spend your savings a bit on things which gives you joy but also motivates you to do better in your life for such rejoices to continue making their debuts into your life.
