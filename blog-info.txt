###**Blog Headline:** ''''''What are Web Frameworks?''''''
###**Blog Content: ** ''''''Web Application Frameworks or simply Web Frameworks represents collection of libraries and modules. It is a software framework that was developed in order to simplify the web development process and make it easier to build a website. It includes templating capabilities that allow you to present information within a browser, provides an environment for scripting how information flows and also contains many application programming interfaces (APIs) for gaining access to underlying data resources. Most frameworks also provide tools in order for web developers to build a content management system (CMS) for managing digital information on websites and the Internet. A web application or development framework can be considered as a pre-built structure that handles the more repetitive processes and features involved with developing a website. This means that a web developer will spend most of their time interacting with the different parts of the web framework through the use of code. Some of the features associated with web frameworks include web caching, authentication and authorisation procedures, database mapping and configuration and URL mapping. It enables a web application developer to write applications without having to bother about low level details such as protocols, thread management etc. The majority of Web Frameworks are exclusively server-side technology. Some Web frameworks are beginning to include AJAX code that helps developers with the particularly tricky task of programming (client-side) the user's browser. Some common examples are Django, Flask, Pyramis, TurboGears, web2py, etc.''''''

###**Blog Headline:** ''''''Why Django will never lose its popularity?''''''
###**Blog Content: ** ''''''Django is a very popular framework when one wants to integrate the functionalities of python and web development. Django can also be used to build websites and blogs in a relatively small period of time, without having to write the entire code from scratch. It is such a powerful framework that it already provides the basic implementation files for developing your website. With python framework behind it, it can also be used for machine learning and for applying many algorithms on the content present upon the website. Django is a simple framework, with a database called "dB SQLite" automatically stored in it for its users. It is user-friendly. It supports basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript for building responsive web applications. It is easy to use and also it is built in python that's why it is most suitable for python lovers out there. This framework is for large and advanced web applications. At the same time here, some might say that many articles came up and said that flask is a better and easier framework to use if going for a machine learning based web application. Well, flask might be a better replacement for Django, but the developer friendly environment and also after looking at the rising popularity of Django, I will say the opposite. Django can help you develop quite large web applications opening up a lot of opportunities for future.''''''

###**Blog Headline:** ''''''Blockchain and cryptocurrency''''''
###**Blog Content: ** ''''''Blockchain is a record of all the transactions involving cryptocurrency in a well-defined form of ledgers. As the name suggests, it is a kind of chain which is very difficult to tamper, modify and hack, making it extremely reliable and fault-tolerant. Cryptocurrencies on the other hand are digital currencies which unlike traditional currencies are not centralized. Their trade is possible in a decentralized manner, which means there is no third-party or government interference over who you can lend or receive cryptos from. There are many kinds of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Polygon, etc. Among all these coins, Bitcoin is the most popular and widely known cryptocurrency. It is so famous and accceptable, that all the other coins are known as shitcoins. One can trade in cryptocurrencies in many forms. You can use either online or software, hardware or paper trading platforms. One way is to open exodus.com and download the desktop or android version of it, and get started with it. As simple as it seems to be, it is not so. There are multiple ways of doing it and often one needs to do proper research from trusted sites to get accustomed to all these businesses. Even while doing trading and sending cryptos in transactions, one has to be very carefull in terms of the encryption techniques and cross-verify whether his or her private-key is getting leaked or not. Apart from all these, there are a number of other factors too which one might consider to become a successful trader, and should keep himself updated about the market fluctuations. It is a very different game and one needs to invest carefully.''''''

###**Blog Headline:** ''''''What is the relationship of human with god?''''''
###**Blog Content: ** ''''''Why are we all here? what is our purpose in life? What are we supposed to do once we are born and what are the principles of life? Is there any book on guidelines of living a perfect life? These are some among the numerous questions which had been asked by philosophers and other spiritual persons from time immemorial.

But have we ever wondered about the basic thing which remains hidden in these questions ourselves? If we think about it deeply, I believe we would come down to the fundamental propencity of enquiring who is god and what is our relationship with him?

Did god created us or we are just a result of evolution of life on planet earth over billions of years? If we assume that god created us, what can be the purpose behind it... If he is so powerful then why would he need us to worship him, pray to him, etc. He is perhaps self-sufficient, a self-subsisting being, both formidable and respledent. I once believed that he created us in the lower domain, because he is all alone in the non-materialistic spiritual upper-domain, and aims to teach us life lessons by providing encumbrances in our path, so that we become like him so that he can share his feelings with us. Thats why he is also referred to as the great teacher in ancient scriptures.

What are your takes on this? Do try to contemplate in your free time!''''''

###**Blog Headline:** ''''''Malls in enhancing Tech-Requirements''''''
###**Blog Content: ** ''''''What can be more refreshing and enjoying than a visit to a mall with your friends after a difficult and hectic exam schedule spanning an entire week? Well, it seems that there are unlikely many general choices other than this for the normies and extrovert people out there. I visited a mall today, not because I had a hectic week of exams, but because I was completely punctured by boredom by sitting on my couch in my home. I must say that a visit to City Center, Rajarhat, Kolkata, was one hell of a refreshing experience for me after a millenium...

But what made this experience wholesome and utterly enjoyable? It seems most of us might answer it with something like the ambience, mouth-watering dishes in restaurants, 4D cinema theatres, gaming centres, etc. But what makes all these things possible in a smooth and effortless manner? It is the technology which keeps all the things going. With tons of new faces advancing into the malls, there's a need for efficient car parking systems, strict supervision through CCTV cameras, automated robots catering to our food orders, high tech gaming zones with VR and AR, and a multitude of shops and kiosks here and there catering to a wide array of services like jewellery, clothing, cutlery, furnishing, healthcare, and a lot more makes the experience of visiting a mall overwhelming!

Computer Science has a big role to play in all these. By making use of databases, recommender systems, back-end and front-end services, automation, cyber spaces, virtual reality, etc., I believe we can enrich the lives of people and lead to an overall amazing experience which makes all these services worth experiencing.''''''
