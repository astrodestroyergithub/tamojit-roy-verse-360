Hey explorers, hope you are doing fine! AI boom is happening already and it seems what really brought this change more than other things (if not less than the others) is the advent of AI Agents and the continual enhancement of the various popular LLM models made possible by their providers. The fact that giving complete control to AI to do the complete work, right from thinking about the problem statement to figuring out it's solution and also implementing it without any human assistance in the entire process whatsoever, has already started taking shape and is finally having some form of prototype (and it is already looking impressive). An AI Agent performs specific, often reactive tasks. They are the "doers" that execute predefined functions. Whereas, Agentic AI is a more sophisticated system that plans, makes decisions, adapts, and learns to achieve broader objectives. On the other hand, what is really behind the frames is an AI model, often known as an LLM model. The various providers of the models like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, etc. are in extreme competition and have been regularly releasing more and more advanced models to keep up with the game. Each model differs in its raw intelligence measure from each other, with few models standing out from the rest. While each model is special in its own way, there is no particular benchmark to compare them (no matter what any AI expert tells). While there has been many attempts to find out the overall intelligence of the models, despite there being many tests to handpick the best of them all, given the everchanging AI landscape and its extreme complexity and black box nature with the water running very deep sometimes. This site called ArtificialAnalysis.AI compares models which are listed based upon various tests, parameters and certain more criteria as well. The models can be compared on their intelligence, speed, price, etc. There are various intelligence evaluations like Terminal-Bench Hard for Agentic Coding & Terminal Use, GPQA Diamond for Scientific Reasoning, Humanity's Last Exam for Reasoning & Knowledge, etc. Other factors do help us classify the models as well like output speed, token limit, context window size, cost efficiency and a billion other factors! The Open LLM Leaderboard Model Comparator from Huggingface provides an interface to compare multiple models by evaluating their responses against multiple tasks and their selected subtasks which are of the user's interest. LMArena is yet another platform which changes the analysis game and takes it on a whole new level. It allows an interface where the user can feed a prompt and it fires up two AI assistants giving some responses side-by-side for the user to decide the better one based upon the user's discretion. It employs a user-centric approach to give the user the freedom to decide what model fits the user's use case and merely takes a simple yet profound step forward towards understanding the requirements better by taking real time feedback. OpenRouter.AI also provides the rankings for the various models hosted on it as per several parameters and benchmarks such as total token usage, market share, programming, images, etc. The leaderboard is updated continually with changing times with each model's rankings getting changes with the flow of time. Apart from analysing the models via these popular analysis platforms, the best way to do the same is by using the models yourself. What kinds of tasks a model excels in and what is its strengths and weaknesses is truly understood when one uses them extensively, tests them thoroughly for doing various kinds of intelligent and rigorous tasks and at the same time truly understands how they function down to the first principle. At the end of the day, there is no hard-and-fast rule to realize the working of each model and perhaps the best way is "learn by doing"! Some providers provide interfaces for the user to interact with their models, some just expose their APIs, some even use the Agentic approach to extend the AI interaction with their users. GitHub Copilot is a popular tool which uses Agentic AI and which helps developers to code faster and it acts just like an assistant software developer to assist the user in developing features faster especially with more efficiency, as they say. But, only legends know what kind of "expertise" they bring to the table! Coming to the popular web applications which often provide a chatbot like interface for the user to use prompts to interact with the LLM models under the hood, we often hear names like ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude, Mistral, Perplexity and many more! Lets look at the features, strengths and weaknesses of some of these platforms. First in our list we have GPT-4o. It comes in the Category of Conversational Agents, and it can be used for content creation and coding. Its key features and abilities include human-like text, nuanced language and best overall model. Next on our list comes the Azure OpenAI. This one can be used for content generation, summarizing and image understanding. It has access to OpenAI models with Azure enterprise features. Next, we have Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It's particularly good in coding and is especially known for that. Although its other advanced variants have already come up like Claude Sonnet 4, it still is very much in the game. It can be used for software development, coding and content creation at the enterprise level. It's advantages are that it outperforms in coding, creative writing and has a lower hallucination rate. Gemini 1.5 Pro is the next one on the list. It is good in data analysis, summarizing long-form text and text content generation. It has strong Google integration and is really made for large jobs. Next one is Claude 3 Haiku. It's good in translation, content moderation and data extraction. It's features are that it handles dense documents quickly, is affordable and can also comprehend prompts. Claude 3 Opus finds its usage in primary use cases like complex cognitive tasks, content creation and code generation. It's features are that it offers advanced reasoning, it is accurate with long contexts and provides enhanced safety. Next, on the list is Gemini 1.5 Flash. It's primary use cases are brainstorming, idea generation, content creation and storytelling. It is known for its speed, processing large amounts of text and advanced reasoning. ChatGPT 4 comes next. Its primary use cases are language processing, code generation and marketing translation. It's key features and abilities are enhanced NLP, customization, scalability and quick responses. GPT-4 Turbo can be used for real-time applications and also for text and document processing. Its fast, more cost effective that GPT-4 and can handle 300 page prompts. Finally on the list we have GPT-5. It can used for content creation research, deep research, image generation and integration with various tools using connectors. The Agent mode requires a ChatGPT subscription of $20 a month and with this you can make upto 40 Agent task calls per month. Being the latest model by ChatGPT, it sure is expensive as hell! GPT-5's Agent Mode is actually great for research and analysis where you can actually verify results. Having talked about some of the most popular models, now I want to test some of them for a simple webpage creation using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no fancy frameworks and no complex technologies to keep things straight and simple). I will be prompting ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Claude, Gemini and Perplexity with my custom markdown prompt also providing the assets for generating the webpage. This is the prompt which I will be using. As you can see, I have included all the sections like role, context, instructions, etc. While prompting those models, I faced some challenges like I couldn't attach unlimited assets to the directive prompt and they got limited to either 3, 8, 20, etc. of them depending upon the model. This really hampered the productivity and the idea of coming up with a full webpage as desired. I am not saying that my prompt is perfect but it is also true that the same prompt is used everywhere. Not to mention that I am using the free plan for all the models and there's that as well. ChatGPT came up with an incomplete webpage, Claude came up with something but there were alignment issues, coloring issues and also the placement of components but still it was not fully complete, Copilot did a better job than the two but still it was not upto the mark although it did manage to include pretty much all the sections and the sticky header as well, Perplexity also did a better job that ChatGPT and Claude but the sections were uneven were not looking appealing, even the icons seemed distorted and it surely felt like some webpage made in great haste just for the sake of creating a webpage, Gemini did the best job among all the models however the 'Participating Schools' section was not designed accurately with overlapping marquees, but the color coding and the proportions seemed decent and by far it did the best job among them all. So, these are the rankings for them along with the key takeaways. The final product always depends on many factors and not just the prompt, and its essential to keep that in mind. Anyways, I tried to do some sort of analysis and tried to do some sort of comparison between some of the popular models and they key findings are purely my own and obviously not concrete.

Hello Connections,

I’m excited to share something I’ve been exploring deeply over the past few weeks. The AI landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, and with it comes a wave of new capabilities, new models, and new possibilities. From agentic systems to advanced LLM benchmarking, the transformations happening behind the scenes are shaping the next era of intelligent automation. I decided to break down this fast-moving world in a way that’s accessible, practical, and insight-driven.

In my latest video, I dive into what’s truly powering the AI boom: the rise of AI Agents and the rapid evolution of leading LLM models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and more. I talk about how AI Agents differ from Agentic AI, how modern benchmarks attempt to measure model intelligence, and why evaluating real-world performance still relies heavily on hands-on testing rather than theoretical metrics.

I also explore several top AI platforms that most of us use every day, often without fully realizing the sophistication behind them. From ChatGPT and Gemini to Claude, Copilot, and Perplexity, I put these models through a practical test: generating a complete webpage using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The results were fascinating. Some models generated partial or misaligned designs, some performed surprisingly well, and one stood out as the most balanced and effective in this specific task.

The video captures not only the comparison but also the key learnings, limitations, and unexpected quirks of each model. My goal was never to declare a single “winner,” but to share an honest, experience-based perspective on what each model brings to the table, and how their strengths and weaknesses show up in real tasks.

If you’re curious about where AI is headed, how these models differ in capability, or what practical outcomes they deliver beyond the hype, I’d love for you to check out the video. Your thoughts, feedback, and perspectives would mean a lot, and I hope it sparks meaningful discussion as we all navigate the future of intelligent technology together.
